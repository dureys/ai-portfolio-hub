# AI Development Context - Session: 2025-07-05

## Current Mission
Building professional AI portfolio showcasing AutoGen multi-agent systems

## Technical Setup Status
- ✅ GitHub CLI: v2.74.2 working
- ✅ Local AI: DeepSeek 33B, 6.7B, 1.3B via Ollama
- ✅ VS Code: Continue extension configured
- ✅ AutoGen: Installed with OpenAI compatibility
- ✅ Repository: ai-portfolio-hub created

## Performance Optimization
- **Issue**: DeepSeek 33B too slow for daily use (10+ seconds)
- **Solution**: Use 6.7B for most tasks, 33B for complex decisions
- **Autocomplete**: 1.3B model for instant responses

## Current Focus
1. Speed up AI responses with right-sized models
2. Build CRM multi-agent automation demo
3. Create portfolio website with live AI demos
4. Ensure all AIs can collaborate via this repository

## Next AI Should Know
- Use deepseek-coder:6.7b for best speed/quality balance
- All code should be committed to this GitHub repo
- Oğuzhan wants to learn concepts, not just copy/paste
- Priority: Making setup accessible to all AI assistants

## Architecture Decisions
- GitHub as central collaboration hub
- Local AI for privacy and cost control
- AutoGen for multi-agent demonstrations
- Streamlit for interactive demos
