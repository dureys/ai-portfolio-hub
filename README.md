# 🚀 AI Portfolio Hub - Building the Future of Business Automation

## Hi, I'm Oğuzhan 👋

I'm a Product Owner turned AI Builder, documenting my journey from managing automation workflows to creating intelligent systems that solve real business problems.

After 6 years of architecting enterprise solutions at companies like Accenture and leading digital transformations, I'm now focused on hands-on AI implementation. This portfolio showcases my transition into building practical AI solutions that bridge the gap between cutting-edge technology and business value.

## 🎯 What I'm Building

I believe AI should enhance human work, not complicate it. My projects focus on:
- **Practical AI Integration**: Connecting LLMs with existing business tools
- **Intelligent Automation**: Transforming manual workflows into AI-powered processes
- **Real Business Impact**: Solutions that deliver measurable results, not just cool demos

## 🛠️ Current Tech Stack

  - OpenAI GPT-4, Claude API, Gemini
  - Local LLMs via Ollama
  - Prompt engineering & optimization

Automation:
  - n8n (self-hosted & cloud)
  - Make.com scenarios
  - Zapier + AI integrations
  
Development:
  - Python for AI scripting
  - REST APIs & webhooks
